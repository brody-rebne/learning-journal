# Growth Mindset

---

The first and most essential thing we discussed was the concept of growth mindset vs fixed mindset, and how a growth mindset enables efficient and effective learning.

The essence of the growth mindset is, when encountering an obstacle in our learning, to *use* the obstacle as a tool to learn more. This enables us to learn from both "positive" and "negative" experiences. A fixed mindset forces us into a box of constantly being blocked by obstacles, creating frustrations that may cause us to stop trying or give up.
