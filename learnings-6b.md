# *How Computers Work*, Notes and Takeaways

## Core Functionality of Computers

The core functionality of a computer has not changed since their invention. They follow a 4 step process to provide value to us as "thinking tools"

- **Input**, or the computer's ability and methods of recieving information in the form of processable data from humans, other computers, and many other sources. The information can include anything information from a keyboard, to complex sensor data from a far distant weather balloon or satellite.

- **Storage**, or the computer's method of retaining that information as it processes and manipulates it to generate new information.

- **Processing**, or the computers capability to combine, transform, and analyze information given to it in order to produce a useful result. This is by far the most in-depth function by definition, since computers' most valuable asset is their versatility and speed in this type of task.

- **Output**, or how the computer returns that data back to whoever or whatever requires it. This can be done simply through a graphic display, or with data packets to be virtually delivered to a remote destination, or analyzed by another computer or program.

## Binary Input

The only way to actually communicate data to an electronic device is with a yes or no value: electricity is on, or electricity is off. This is why computers' input and output is all based in binary, a numerical system using base 2. This allows us to communicate numbers of any size to computers through a series of bits, which can then be translated into text, images, or anything else the computer can process.

Circuitry responding to binary input controls everything a computer does, from multiplying two numbers on a calculator, to storing a file in memory, to rendering a 3d graphic in a VR world.

## Software and Hardware

Today, software is built in more semantic languages meant to bridge the linguistic gap between machines and humans. Eventually the commands go through layers and layers interpretation to end up as communicable binary, but they allow for much more reasonable and legible commands for us to interface with. Much of software is built to create Operating Systems, Applications, and User Interfaces, creating layers on top of itself to make communicating with a machine even simpler and more human.
