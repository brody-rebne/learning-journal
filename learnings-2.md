# Terminal Basics and the Text Editor

## Terminal Basics

Terminal is a more manual, and, for development purposes, more efficient method of accessing and manipulating files. Within the terminal, one uses shorthand commands to perform a vast range of operations on files and directories.

Below is a list of terminal commands we learned on Dec 16th.

- cd [name] - Change directory
  - cd .. - Return to root directory
- ls - List files in current directory (short)
  - ls -l - List files in current directory (long)
- touch [name] - Create new file
- mkdir [name] - Create new directory
- rm [name] - Remove file
- rmdir [name] - Remove directory

## The Text Editor

We were also introduced to the concept of Text Editors. Text editors range from extremely simple text generating tools like Notepad, to more markdown oriented "WYSIWYG" applications like MS Word, to more capable coding-oriented tools like VS Code, Atom, and Sublime.

The variety of different options each generally have pros and cons. Lighter weight, more basic programs like Sublime and Notepad++ tend to have very customizable, via built-in options and third-party extensions. More fleshed-out programs like VS Code and Atom are still customizable with extensions and plugins, but offer a more complete coding environment straight from the box, and generally offer more support and integration.
