# JavaScript Basics

## Intro to JavaScript

JavaScript (JS for short) is a flexible scripting language designed to provide functionality to web code. Initially developed as a purely front-end language, it has since been adapted and commonly adopted in back-end software as well.

JS is, in essence, a method of providing operating instructions to a computer. It works around a few key concepts, mainly focused on using logical steps to either perform a conditional operation, or manipulating the values of set variables (containers for changeable values) to alter the information delivered through the application.

These logical steps can be expressed in 3 primary ways:

- **Functions**, which can be called any time in the code to perform a specific set of steps and return a value.
- **Methods** are similar to functions, but they can be called in a more specifically defined context.
- **Loops** are fleshed-out blocks of code that run a set of logical steps until they reach a result. They generally use simple logical operators like `if` `else` and `and`, and can result in any number of operations.

These scripts are injected into the HTML similar (but not exactly) like how a CSS sheet or image would be, and can be done inline using the `<script></script>` tag if necessary.
