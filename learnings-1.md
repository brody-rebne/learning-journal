# GitHub Repositories and Markdown Basics #

**GitHub Repositories**

We've spent some time now creating and deploying a GitHub repository (repo, for short). Repos are GitHub's method of storing files for development projects, both for businesses and individuals. They allow anyone to create simpler and more shareable codebases.

We created a simple, self-referential site, and published it to a public GitHub Pages site. We applied a GitHub-supplied theme and created a README file, learning to commit changes and seeing how they affect a deployed site. We will continue to add to this site as we continue to learn.

**Markdown Basics**

Markdown is a simple styling language often used forums and GitHub README files, for the purpose of styling user-input text in a standardized and reusable fashion.
